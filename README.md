AMD AI Hackathon project 

## Hackathon Overview

### Track 1 : AMD AI Premier League (AAIPL)

A head-to-head AI competition where teams of up to 3 developers build two intelligent language model based agents:

* ​Q-agent: Generates valid, challenging multiple choice questions belonging to a given domain.

* ​A-agent: Attempts to answer questions posed by the opposing team’s Q-agent.

* ​Goal: Create a question generator that can pose the most difficult yet correct questions while ensuring your answerer can accurately answer as many of them.

#### ​Format:

​Matches are played between pairs of teams where one team's Q-agent generates a set of questions to which A-agent of the opposing team responds and vice-versa.

​Winning teams advance to the next stage.

#### ​Resources Provided:

* ​1 MI300 GPU for 24 hours

* Sample code for prompt tuning, reinforcement learning, and fine-tuning

#### ​Deliverables:
